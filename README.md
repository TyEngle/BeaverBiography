Created for: QAP1 Semester 2 Front End Development, hosted by Keyin College.

Intent was to design a wiki-like page with content of our choosing. I created my web page based around the American Beaver.

Content includes the following pages: Index, About, Styling, Summary, and a Media folder.

Index refers to the main page which includes links to information on different parts of the page.

About is a section about myself and the project.

Summary is a short summary of all the information, in the format of a free-verse essay.

Styling is simply the CSS which styles the webpages.

Media folder contains any media used--photos, videos, sound clips, etc.
