          <span id="first">Y</span>ou are viewing a free verse essay of sorts
          written by myself. This essay is basically an overview and summary of
          all the cool information I learned about the American beaver while
          creating this webpage. I decided to break it into seperate paragraphs
          so it is easier to read; Enjoy!

        <h2>The American beaver</h2>
        <p>
          <span Class="first">T</span>he American Beaver, or more commonly known
          inside of north America simply as “the beaver”, is a large member of
          the rodent family. In fact, with a body of two to three feet in
          length, it is the second biggest of the rodents-second only to the
          monstrous capibara.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most notable thing about the beaver is its large black paddle-like
          tail. If you look at it closely you can see it is covered with large
          scales, like a dragon or a dinosaur! Beavers have four short little
          legs and black feet with 5 little digits on each paw. Their front paws
          are more dextrous and are primarily used for things like digging,
          folding leaves while eating, and spinning off little twigs while
          gnawing at bark. Their back paws, aside from their first and second
          toes, are all webbed like little flippers to help with swimming.

          On average their fur is brown in color. Actually, their fur consists
          of two different types and lengths: the long coarse outer hairs, and
          the short fine inner hairs. Underneath those layers of fur (and a
          layer of skin) is a thick layer of fat, to insulate the beaver in a
          cold environment (perhaps also useful for cold water settings).
        </p>
        <p>
          Beavers have learned to coat their fur with <em>castoreum</em>-an oily
          substance secreted from “castor glands” located near the cloaca-to
          make it waterproof! This is important because beavers are
          <em>semiaquatic</em>-which means they spend a significant part of
          their time under or in the water. Their eyes are covered with a
          <em>nictitating membrane</em>-which is basically a coating that allows
          the beaver to see well under the water, it's as if they can see
          through their eyelids! Another cool aquatic trait of the beaver is
          that their nostrils and ears seal up when they go under the water;
          They can also close their lips behind the front teeth, which allows
          them to gnaw at things under the water, how neat! Beavers can hold
          their breath underwater for up to 15 minutes at a time. This is
          beneficial to their environment since beavers usually live in ponds,
          lakes, rivers, and streams across most of the
          <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> (exception of the
          states that are mostly desert).
        </p>
        <p>
          The beaver's home is referred to as a lodge. It is made of sticks and
          mud, often having access from under the water. Beavers are one of the
          few animals that are actively capable of messing up an entire eco
          system. They are great at making dams, so restricting the flow of
          water is a simple task for a beaver; they can even redistribute the
          flow or create a whole new body of water!
        </p>
        <p>
          Their teeth are constantly and infinitely growing, so they are always
          gnawing at bark to stop them from growing too long (Perhaps this is
          why they frequently build dams, to make use of their labor!).

          Their species became near extinct because of beaver fur being such a
          good resource for fur hats, as well as the different chemicals they
          secrete being great additives in perfumes etc. Their real saving grace
          was the sudden change in fashion trends.

          The beaver is thought to have gotten to North America across the
          Bering Straight-which is basically a straight across the pacific and
          arctic oceans between Russia and USA. The first ever record of a
          beaver was found in Germany 10-12 million years ago. The first finding
          in North America however was 7 million years ago, of two beaver teeth,
          found near Dayvile, Oregon. The beaver is the official state mammal of
          Oregon and New York, and is also an official symbol of the National
          Wildlife of Canada.

          The beaver is a very intelligent mammal; it is sad to realize they
          near went extinct all due to the greed of humanity. Just because it is
          a rodent doesn't mean it is any less of a being! Listen to this sound
