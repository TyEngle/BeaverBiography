          <h3>Appendages</h3>

          <h4>Tail</h4>
          <p>
            The American beaver has a large black paddle-like tail. The tail is
            mostly hairless and covered with large scales. If it feels
            threatened it is found to slap its large tail against the
            ground/water.
          </p>
          <h4>Legs</h4>
          <p>
            The American beaver has short furry legs and black webbed feet, with
            five digits on each foot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The front paws are more dextrous-primarily used for digging, folding
            leaves while eating, and twisting off small twigs as they gnaw at
            bark. Their hind feet are mostly webbed with the exeption of their
            first and second toes. This is thought to help with grooming.
          </p>
          <h4>Mouth and Teeth</h4>
          <p>
            The American beaver has the struggle of ever-growing incisors,
            meaning, their teeth never stop growing. They gnaw on bark mainly to
            keep these teeth from getting too long. While underwater, the beaver
            can close their lips beind their front teeth, allowing them to gnaw
            things even while underwater!

          <span Class="first">T</span>he American beaver lives primarily in
          areas like ponds, rivers, lakes, and streams all across the USA; other
          than the more desert filled areas. After being near hunted to
          extinction, The American Beaver species was reintroduced to places
          like Spain, Great Britain, and some areas in China and Mongolia.

          The beavers home is known as a lodge. It is primarily made up of
          branches, sticks, mud, and tends to have an opening accessible only
          from under the water. While beavers tend to build lodges, they tend to
          make dams much more often. They can even change the entire flow of
          water or create a whole new body of water, making them one of the few
          mammals capable of actively changing an ecosystem.

          <span Class="first">O</span>nce believed to be up to 25 seperate
          subspecies of The American beaver, it has since become difficult to
          determine the true numbers because of the large scale genetic mixing
          that has taken place; This is mainly due to the mass 'reintroduction'
          efforts with the intent to help the species recover their numbers.

          <span Class="first">T</span>he first ever record of The American
          beaver is from Germany 10-12 million years ago. The first record in
          North America is from Dayvile, Oregon 7 million years ago; two beaver
          teeth were found there. It is thought that they migrated to North
          America across the

          The American beaver was previously introduced into Patagonia South
          America, and Finland + Karelia in Europe. They have often been hunted
          for a chemical called "castoreum". Castoreum is an oily substance
          secreted by the 'castor glands' which are located near the cloaca.
          This chemical(along with a few others) would be refined mainly into
          vanity items like perfumes.

          When fur hats came onto the fashion scene, people turned more often to
          beavers for thier beautiful fur. For this purpose it was near hunted
          to extinction. The real saving grace for their species as a whole was
          the sudden change in fashion style; fur hats died off, so people
          turned their attention from the beaver. Since then, the American
          beaver as a species has recovered exceptionally well throughout
          Europe. They have been reintroduced to other areas across the world
          too, however, The American Beaver's population in Europe is
          flourishing so much so that it alone was reason enough for them to be
          taken off the endangered species list.
