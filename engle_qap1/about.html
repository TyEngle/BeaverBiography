      <p>
        <span id="first">L</span>et me start by introducing myself; my name is
        Tyler Engle. I am a student at Keyin College currently in my second
        semester of Software Development. This is the first
        <abbr title="Quantitive Assessment Practice">QAP</abbr>
        of the semester: we are to create a webpage containing information on a
        species located in
        <span class="links"
          ><a
            href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&view=species"

        >. As you already know, I chose to research The 'American' beaver.

      <h3>The following are the required assessment <em>problems</em>:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment?</li>
        <li>What online resources you have used?</li>
        <li>Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems</li>
        <li>
          Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how
          many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you
          require)?
        </li>
        <li>
          Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own
          perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a
          similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in
          the future now that you've completed this one.
        </li>

      <h3>The following are the required assessment <em>answers</em>:</h3>

          Time spent was roughly 3 hours of research, 1-2 hours writing up the
          essay, and somewhere between 7-10 hours working on the webpage; I
          worked on it for 3 seperate session of about 3 hours each.
        </li>
        <li>Online resources used were w3 schools, and class notes.</li>
        <li>
          I did not need to ask my peers for help, however, I did have a meeting
          with Scott where we worked on our projects and bounced brainwaves back
          and forth.
        </li>
        <li>
          I asked my instructor if I need to replace all symbols with
          <abbr title="American Standard Code For Information Interchange">
            ASCII</abbr
          >
          code.
        </li>
        <li>
          I did not find this project particularly difficult; doing up the
          webpage was the easy part. I feel that I have a good understanding of
          <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> syntax. The
          difficult part for me was obtaining and sorting the information,
          paraphrasing it, and creating a summarizing essay.

          <span Class="first">A</span>s you know already my name is Tyler Engle.
          I am 26 living on the western side of Newfoundland. In school for
          Software Development and living with my girlfriend. I chose to do The
          American beaver for this project because, well, beavers are my
          favorite mammal. I think they are very misunderstood creatures, and
          get a bad reputation just because some scientists put them under the
          "rodent" tag.
